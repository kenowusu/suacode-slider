## About
So a friend who happens to be a web developer at suacode.ai hit me up and was like he is using a prebuilt  theme but was not happy with the testimonial slider that comes with the theme. He had already struggled installing dozens of plugins just to get a good testimonial slider working.

I came up with the idea of developing this plugin for him using wordpress shortcode. The plugins works by extracting custom postTypes named testimonial and putting them in a slider.The slider uses the Jquery slick slider plugin


Slider can be found on https://suacode.ai
